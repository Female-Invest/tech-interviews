# Female Invest technical interview

Welcome to the Female Invest technical interview! First of all, thank you for
taking the time to take it. We know it's a somewhat stressful process, but alas,
it's a necessary one. On our part, we'll try to make it as smooth as possible
for you and us as well.

The technical interview is divided into two parts:

1. **Take-home assignment.**

   The take-home assignment is a relatively short (max 4 hours) technical
   exercise that we ask you to complete on your own before inviting you in for
   the second part of the interview. The subject of the assignment depends on
   the role you're interviewing for. You can find assignments for the various
   roles in the [assignments](./assignments/) directory of this repository.

   Once you've completed the assignment, you should send it to us in one way or
   another. We will then evaluate it and we will review it before the interview.

2. **Live interview with pair programming.**

   The second part of the technical interview is a ~90-minute live interview.
   Together we'll go through your take-home assignment and we'll ask you to pair
   with us on extending it in some way.

   This part will focus on extending your solution of the case. This can include
   both diving deeper into elements already presented in your case, and adding
   additional functionality to the solution.

You should have received an email with instructions on which assignment you
should focus on. If you have any questions regarding the case feel free to ask
your recruiting contact.

Good luck and talk to you soon!
